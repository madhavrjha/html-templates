          <h2>NSC Examinations</h2>
          <p>
            The National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly referred
            to as “matric” has become an annual event of major public
            significance. It not only signifies the culmination of twelve years
            of formal schooling but the NSC examinations is a barometer of the
            health of the education system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first national examination, under the newly elected democratic
            government was administered in November 1996, following a highly
            decentralized approach.
